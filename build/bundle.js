But bees know\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    that every small job,\r\n    if it's done well, means a lot.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    But choose carefully\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    because you'll stay in the job\r\n    you pick for the rest of your life.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    The same job the rest of your life?\r\n    I didn't know that.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    What's the difference?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You'll be happy to know that bees,\r\n    as a species, haven't had one day off\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    in 27 million years.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    So you'll just work us to death?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    We'll sure try.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Wow! That blew my mind!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    \"What's the difference?\"\r\n    How can you say that?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    One job forever?\r\n    That's an insane choice to have to make.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm relieved.

Give me one example.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I don't know.

That's more pollen\r\n    than you and I will see in a lifetime.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    It's just a status symbol.\r\n    Bees make too much of it.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Perhaps.

Star Wars?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Nah, I don't go for that...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    ...kind of stuff.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.\r\n    They're out of their minds.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    When I leave a job interview, they're\r\n    flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I don't remember the sun\r\n    having a big 75 on it.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I predicted global warming.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I could feel it getting hotter.\r\n    At first I thought it was just me.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Wait! Stop! Bee!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Stand back. These are winter boots.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Wait!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Don't kill him!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You know I'm allergic to them!\r\n    This thing could kill me!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Why does his life have\r\n    less value than yours?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Why does his life have any less value\r\n    than mine? Is that your statement?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm just saying all life has value. You\r\n    don't know what he's capable of feeling.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    My brochure!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    There you go, little guy.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm not scared of him.\r\n    It's an allergic thing.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Put that on your resume brochure.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    My whole face could puff up.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Make it one of your special skills.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Knocking someone out\r\n    is also a special skill.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?\r\n    - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - You could put carob chips on there.\r\n    - Bye.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Supposed to be less calories.\r\n    - Bye.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I gotta say something.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    She saved my life.\r\n    I gotta say something.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    All right, here it goes.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Nah.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    What would I say?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I could really get in trouble.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    It's a bee law.\r\n    You're not supposed to talk to a human.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I can't believe I'm doing this.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I've got to.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No. Yes. No.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Do it. I can't.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    How should I start it?\r\n    \"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Here she comes! Speak, you fool!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Hi!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm sorry.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - You're talking.\r\n    - Yes, I know.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You're talking!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm so sorry.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No, it's OK. It's fine.\r\n    I know I'm dreaming.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    But I don't recall going to bed.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Well, I'm sure this\r\n    is very disconcerting.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    This is a bit of a surprise to me.\r\n    I mean, you're a bee!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I am. And I'm not supposed\r\n    to be doing this,\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    but they were all trying to kill me.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    And if it wasn't for you...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I had to thank you.\r\n    It's just how I was raised.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    That was a little weird.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - I'm talking with a bee.\r\n    - Yeah.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm talking to a bee.\r\n    And the bee is talking to me!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I just want to say I'm grateful.\r\n    I'll leave now.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Wait! How did you learn to do that?\r\n    - What?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    The talking thing.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Same way you did, I guess.\r\n    \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - That's very funny.\r\n    - Yeah.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,\r\n    we'd cry with what we have to deal with.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Anyway...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oan I...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    ...get you something?\r\n    - Like what?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I don't know. I mean...\r\n    I don't know. Ooffee?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I don't want to put you out.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - It's just coffee.\r\n    - I hate to impose.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Don't be ridiculous!\r\n    - Actually, I would love a cup.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Hey, you want rum cake?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - I shouldn't.\r\n    - Have some.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - No, I can't.\r\n    - Oome on!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Where?\r\n    - These stripes don't help.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You look great!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I don't know if you know\r\n    anything about fashion.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Are you all right?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    He's making the tie in the cab\r\n    as they're flying up Madison.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    He finally gets there.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    He runs up the steps into the church.\r\n    The wedding is on.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    And he says, \"Watermelon?\r\n    I thought you said Guatemalan.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Why would I marry a watermelon?\"\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Is that a bee joke?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    That's the kind of stuff we do.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Yeah, different.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    So, what are you gonna do, Barry?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    About work? I don't know.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I want to do my part for the hive,\r\n    but I can't do it the way they want.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I know how you feel.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - You do?\r\n    - Sure.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\r\n    a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Really?\r\n    - My only interest is flowers.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Our new queen was just elected\r\n    with that same campaign slogan.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Anyway, if you look...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    There's my hive right there. See it?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You're in Sheep Meadow!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No way! I know that area.\r\n    I lost a toe ring there once.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Why do girls put rings on their toes?\r\n    - Why not?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - It's like putting a hat on your knee.\r\n    - Maybe I'll try that.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - You all right, ma'am?\r\n    - Oh, yeah. Fine.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Just having two cups of coffee!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Anyway, this has been great.\r\n    Thanks for the coffee.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Yeah, it's no trouble.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,\r\n    I'd be up the rest of my life.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Are you...?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oan I take a piece of this with me?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Sure! Here, have a crumb.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Thanks!\r\n    - Yeah.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    All right. Well, then...\r\n    I guess I'll see you around.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Or not.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    OK, Barry.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    And thank you\r\n    so much again... for before.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oh, that? That was nothing.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    This can't possibly work.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    He's all set to go.\r\n    We may as well try it.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    OK, Dave, pull the chute.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Sounds amazing.\r\n    - It was amazing!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    It was the scariest,\r\n    happiest moment of my life.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Humans! I can't believe\r\n    you were with humans!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Giant, scary humans!\r\n    What were they like?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    They eat crazy giant things.\r\n    They drive crazy.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Do they try and kill you, like on TV?\r\n    - Some of them. But some of them don't.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - How'd you get back?\r\n    - Poodle.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You did it, and I'm glad. You saw\r\n    whatever you wanted to see.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You had your \"experience.\" Now you\r\n    can pick out yourjob and be normal.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Well...\r\n    - Well?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Well, I met someone.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You did? Was she Bee-ish?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\r\n    - No, no, no, not a wasp.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Spider?\r\n    - I'm not attracted to spiders.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I know it's the hottest thing,\r\n    with the eight legs and all.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I can't get by that face.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    So who is she?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    She's... human.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No, no. That's a bee law.\r\n    You wouldn't break a bee law.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Her name's Vanessa.\r\n    - Oh, boy.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    She's so nice. And she's a florist!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    We're not dating.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You're flying outside the hive, talking\r\n    to humans that attack our homes\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    with power washers and M-80s!\r\n    One-eighth a stick of dynamite!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    She saved my life!\r\n    And she understands me.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    This is over!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Eat this.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    This is not over! What was that?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - They call it a crumb.\r\n    - It was so stingin' stripey!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    And that's not what they eat.\r\n    That's what falls off what they eat!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - You know what a Oinnabon is?\r\n    - No.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\r\n    They heat it up...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Sit down!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    ...really hot!\r\n    - Listen to me!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    We are not them! We're us.\r\n    There's us and there's them!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Yes, but who can deny\r\n    the heart that is yearning?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    There's no yearning.\r\n    Stop yearning.

You have no life!\r\n    You have no job. You're barely a bee!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Would it kill you\r\n    to make a little honey?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Barry, come out.\r\n    Your father's talking to you.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Martin, would you talk to him?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Barry, I'm talking to you!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You coming?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Got everything?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    All set!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Go ahead.

Yes, Your Honor,\r\n    we're ready to proceed.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Mr. Montgomery,\r\n    your opening statement, please.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    my grandmother was a simple woman.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Born on a farm, she believed\r\n    it was man's divine right\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    to benefit from the bounty\r\n    of nature God put before us.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    If we lived in the topsy-turvy world\r\n    Mr. Benson imagines,\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    just think of what would it mean.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I would have to negotiate\r\n    with the silkworm\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    for the elastic in my britches!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Talking bee!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    How do we know this isn't some sort of\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    holographic motion-picture-capture\r\n    Hollywood wizardry?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    They could be using laser beams!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Robotics! Ventriloquism!\r\n    Oloning! For all we know,\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    he could be on steroids!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Mr. Benson?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Ladies and gentlemen,\r\n    there's no trickery here.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm just an ordinary bee.\r\n    Honey's pretty important to me.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    It's important to all bees.\r\n    We invented it!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    We make it. And we protect it\r\n    with our lives.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Unfortunately, there are\r\n    some people in this room\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    who think they can take it from us\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    'cause we're the little guys!\r\n    I'm hoping that, after this is all over,\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    you'll see how, by taking our honey,\r\n    you not only take everything we have\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    but everything we are!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I wish he'd dress like that\r\n    all the time. So nice!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oall your first witness.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\r\n    of Honey Farms, big company you have.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I suppose so.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I see you also own\r\n    Honeyburton and Honron!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Yes, they provide beekeepers\r\n    for our farms.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Beekeeper. I find that\r\n    to be a very disturbing term.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I don't imagine you employ\r\n    any bee-free-ers, do you?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - No.\r\n    - I couldn't hear you.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - No.\r\n    - No.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Because you don't free bees.\r\n    You keep bees. Not only that,\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    it seems you thought a bear would be\r\n    an appropriate image for a jar of honey.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    They're very lovable creatures.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You mean like this?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Bears kill bees!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    How'd you like his head crashing\r\n    through your living room?!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Biting into your couch!\r\n    Spitting out your throw pillows!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    OK, that's enough. Take him away.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\r\n    Your name intrigues me.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Where have I heard it before?\r\n    - I was with a band called The Police.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    But you've never been\r\n    a police officer, have you?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No, I haven't.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No, you haven't. And so here\r\n    we have yet another example\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    of bee culture casually\r\n    stolen by a human\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    for nothing more than\r\n    a prance-about stage name.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oh, please.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Because I'm feeling\r\n    a little stung, Sting.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    That's not his real name?! You idiots!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Mr. Liotta, first,\r\n    belated congratulations on\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    your Emmy win for a guest spot\r\n    on ER in 2005.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Thank you. Thank you.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I see from your resume\r\n    that you're devilishly handsome\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    with a churning inner turmoil\r\n    that's ready to blow.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Not yet it isn't. But is this\r\n    what it's come to for you?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Exploiting tiny, helpless bees\r\n    so you don't\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    have to rehearse\r\n    your part and learn your lines, sir?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Watch it, Benson!\r\n    I could blow right now!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    This isn't a goodfella.\r\n    This is a badfella!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Why doesn't someone just step on\r\n    this creep, and we can all go home?!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Order in this court!\r\n    - You're all thinking it!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Order! Order, I say!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Say it!\r\n    - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I think it was awfully nice\r\n    of that bear to pitch in like that.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I think the jury's on our side.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Are we doing everything right, legally?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm a florist.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Right. Well, here's to a great team.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    To a great team!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Well, hello.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Ken!\r\n    - Hello.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I didn't think you were coming.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No, I was just late.\r\n    I tried to call, but... the battery.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I didn't want all this to go to waste,\r\n    so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oh, that was lucky.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    There's a little left.\r\n    I could heat it up.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    So I hear you're quite a tennis player.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm not much for the game myself.\r\n    The ball's a little grabby.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    That's where I usually sit.\r\n    Right... there.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    and he agreed with me that eating with\r\n    chopsticks isn't really a special skill.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You think I don't see what you're doing?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I know how hard it is to find\r\n    the rightjob. We have that in common.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Do we?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Bees have 100 percent employment,\r\n    but we do jobs like taking the crud out.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    That's just what\r\n    I was thinking about doing.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor\r\n    for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm going to drain the old stinger.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Yeah, you do that.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Look at that.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You know, I've just about had it\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    with your little mind games.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - What's that?\r\n    - Italian Vogue.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    A lot of ads.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Remember what Van said, why is\r\n    your life more valuable than mine?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I think something stinks in here!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I love the smell of flowers.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    How do you like the smell of flames?!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Not as much.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Water bug! Not taking sides!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\r\n    This is pathetic!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I've got issues!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Well, well, well, a royal flush!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - You're bluffing.\r\n    - Am I?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Surf's up, dude!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Poo water!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    That bowl is gnarly.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Except for those dirty yellow rings!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Kenneth! What are you doing?!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You know, I don't even like honey!\r\n    I don't eat it!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    We need to talk!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    He's just a little bee!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    And he happens to be\r\n    the nicest bee I've met in a long time!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Long time? What are you talking about?!\r\n    Are there other bugs in your life?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    No, but there are other things bugging\r\n    me in life. And you're one of them!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    My nerves are fried from riding\r\n    on this emotional roller coaster!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Goodbye, Ken.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    And for your information,\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I prefer sugar-free, artificial\r\n    sweeteners made by man!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'm sorry about all that.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I know it's got\r\n    an aftertaste! I like it!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I always felt there was some kind\r\n    of barrier between Ken and me.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I couldn't overcome it.\r\n    Oh, well.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Are you OK for the trial?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I believe Mr. Montgomery\r\n    is about out of ideas.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    We would like to call\r\n    Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Good idea! You can really see why he's\r\n    considered one of the best lawyers...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Yeah.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Layton, you've\r\n    gotta weave some magic\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    with this jury,\r\n    or it's gonna be all over.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Don't worry. The only thing I have\r\n    to do to turn this jury around\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    is to remind them\r\n    of what they don't like about bees.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - You got the tweezers?\r\n    - Are you allergic?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Only to losing, son. Only to losing.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\r\n    what I think we'd all like to know.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    What exactly is your relationship\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    to that woman?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    We're friends.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Good friends?\r\n    - Yes.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    How good? Do you live together?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Wait a minute...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Are you her little...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    ...bedbug?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I've seen a bee documentary or two.\r\n    From what I understand,\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    doesn't your queen give birth\r\n    to all the bee children?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Yeah, but...\r\n    - So those aren't your real parents!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Oh, Barry...\r\n    - Yes, they are!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Hold me back!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You're an illegitimate bee,\r\n    aren't you, Benson?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    He's denouncing bees!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Don't y'all date your cousins?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Objection!\r\n    - I'm going to pincushion this guy!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Adam, don't! It's what he wants!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oh, I'm hit!!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oh, lordy, I am hit!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Order! Order!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    The venom! The venom\r\n    is coursing through my veins!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I have been felled\r\n    by a winged beast of destruction!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You see? You can't treat them\r\n    like equals! They're striped savages!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Stinging's the only thing\r\n    they know! It's their way!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Adam, stay with me.\r\n    - I can't feel my legs.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    What angel of mercy\r\n    will come forward to suck the poison\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    from my heaving buttocks?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I will have order in this court. Order!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Order, please!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    The case of the honeybees\r\n    versus the human race\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    took a pointed turn against the bees\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    yesterday when one of their legal\r\n    team stung Layton T. Montgomery.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Hey, buddy.\r\n    - Hey.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Is there much pain?\r\n    - Yeah.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I blew the whole case, didn't I?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    It doesn't matter. What matters is\r\n    you're alive. You could have died.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I'd be better off dead. Look at me.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    They got it from the cafeteria\r\n    downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Look, there's\r\n    a little celery still on it.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    What was it like to sting someone?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I can't explain it. It was all...\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    All adrenaline and then...\r\n    and then ecstasy!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    All right.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    You think it was all a trap?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Of course. I'm sorry.\r\n    I flew us right into this.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    What were we thinking? Look at us. We're\r\n    just a couple of bugs in this world.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    What will the humans do to us\r\n    if they win?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I don't know.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    I hear they put the roaches in motels.\r\n    That doesn't sound so bad.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Adam, they check in,\r\n    but they don't check out!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oh, my.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Oould you get a nurse\r\n    to close that window?\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    - Why?\r\n    - The smoke.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Bees don't smoke.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Right. Bees don't smoke.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Bees don't smoke!\r\n    But some bees are smoking.\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    That's it! That's our case!\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    It is?
